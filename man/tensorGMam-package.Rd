\title{
  A tensor estimation approach to integrative mulit-view multivariate additive models
}
\description{
  For a high-dimensional grouped multivariate additive model (GMAM) using B-splines, with or without aparsity assumptions, 
  treating the coefficients as a third-order or even fourth-order tensor and borrowing Tucker decomposition to reduce the       number of parameters. The multivariate sparse group lasso (mcp or scad) and the coordinate descent algorithm are used to      estimate functions for sparsity situation.

  This section should provide a more detailed overview of how to use the
  package, including the most important functions.
